# Specification Quality Checklist: Apple Container 1.0 Support with Container Machine

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
- Version fix (FR-010) is captured as P1 and can be implemented independently as a trivial change.
- Apple Container 1.0 compatibility review (US-6) is explicitly scoped to output parsing; system property removal is noted as likely low-impact based on current actui capabilities.
- Container machine create (US-4) is marked P3 and can be deferred if the iteration is time-boxed.
